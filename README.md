# eCommerce UX inspiration

## Overview

Look for a bunch of different eCommerce websites that you think are similar to your own—maybe competitors. (You have hopefully already done most of this as part of doing your competitive analysis.)

- Find components & patterns on websites
- Find user experiences
- Find colour palettes
- Find text descriptions
- Find layouts
- *Find whatever…*

**Write a quick sentence on each thing you find explaining why it’s appropriate for your website or why it inspires you.**

*You’ll be showing this “inspiration board” to the teacher—who will look, critique & ask questions.*
